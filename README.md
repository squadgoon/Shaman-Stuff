# Specs
## Restoration
### Full Resto 0/5/46
- https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-5-552350510553151 Simple maximum throughput build. There is little synergy to be gained from the other trees that directly benefit healing.
### Improved Weapon Totems Resto 0/22/29 
- https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-502023210052-05035051050014 Points in Ancestral Healing can be moved to Tidal Mastery, trading additional mitigation for additional throughput. This is a great spec for maintaining some semblance of solo ability between using a 2-hander, usable Ghost Wolf, and lighting shield damage. For raiding, however, the benefits are quite marginal. Rank 3 Windfury totem has a 20% chance to give a melee DPS one additional attack with 315 bonus attack power, average that across five swings and you’ve got 63 additional attack power per swing. For a 22-point investment in Enhancement you raise that number by 21 attack power, while losing a great amount of healing throughput and fringe benefits (mana tide totem, healing wave talents). Many will tell you this is the correct raiding spec, but it is easy for a Rogue or Warrior to tell someone else to move 22 talent points for less than a Winterfall Firewater’s amount of benefit.
### Farming Resto 0/26/25
- https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-50250021050231-0500535105001  For the player that can’t spend a lot of gold respeccing every week but needs to be able to reliably farm enemies, this is a good option. You lose a lot of healing throughput but have a competent chain heal and some nice buffed totems to bring to the group.

## Enhancement
### Nature’s Guidance Enh
- https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-5005232105023151-05205301 Shamans need to have 9% hit total (6% for an Orc with an axe) to be hit capped. Gearing for 9% hit is not easy nor cheap nor much fun, so this build cuts that down by 3% (and bonus, the talent applies to your spells too!). There are a couple of flexible points here such as Imp Lightning Shield and Imp Reincarnation, but these are good suggestions. Lightning shield triggers on most boss mechanics and is essentially a free 600+ damage from being cast before the fight. Rarely will you be casting this mid-fight on raid bosses as mana is much more at a premium.
### Elemental Devastation 20/31/0
- https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55003110203-5005202105023051 Once you have 9% hit from gear, this spec begins to pull ahead of the Nature’s Guidance build. A bit more bursty, a bit more mana efficient (thanks to Elemental Focus). The main drawback from this build is that you lose the 3% spell hit that Nature’s Guidance was so kind to provide. A hallmark of this build is its ability to use Rank 1 Earth Shock to fish for Clearcasting procs while mana consumables are on cooldown. 
### Non-raiding farming build 18/20/13
- https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55003110003-5005220105-050053 Not recommended for raid usage. Fighting non-elite enemies you will not need any +hit gear thanks to Nature’s Guidance.
### Elemental Flurry – 31/20/0
- https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/550031052030151-5005202105 A less typical “enhancement” build but is capable of insane parses with good luck. This build has the flexibility to be used as a full Elemental ranged DPS spec as well as an insanely bursty melee DPS spec. A great Shaman will switch between the two as some fights favor melee, and others ranged dps. Requires a lot of high level gear, as there is no bonus hit for melee nor spells.

### Elemental Fury
– 32/5/14 https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/550031052031151-5-05005301 Typical raiding spec. Benefits from spell hit in Nature’s Guidance and reduced totem mana cost.
### Nature’s Swiftness
– 30/0/21 https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55003105203015--0510530100501 Loses Elemental Fury in favor of Nature’s Swiftness and 5% crit from Tidal Mastery.
